# College Event Crowdsourcing Platform - Database Configuration
# 
# If you get database connection errors, update the password in:
# src/main/java/com/college/eventcrowdsourcing/database/DatabaseManager.java
# 
# Common MySQL password scenarios:
# 1. No password: DB_PASSWORD = "";
# 2. Password "root": DB_PASSWORD = "root";
# 3. Password "password": DB_PASSWORD = "password";
# 4. Custom password: DB_PASSWORD = "your_password";
#
# To test your MySQL connection manually:
# mysql -u root -p
# (enter your password when prompted)
#
# If MySQL asks for a password and you don't know it:
# 1. Try empty password (just press Enter)
# 2. Try "root" as password
# 3. Try "password" as password
# 4. Check your MySQL installation documentation
